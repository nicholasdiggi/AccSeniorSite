    <h1 class="dialogueHeader">How to Create an Personal Account for a Website</h1>
    <p class="dialogue">Many websites require you to register a personal account. Online account registration is a
      process that allows you to create a personal account on a website or
      application. This account can help you access special features, make purchases, or interact with other users on
      the website.

      <br><br>To register for an online account, you usually need to provide some basic information like your name,
      email
      address, and a password. Some websites may also ask for additional information like your phone number, date of
      birth, or mailing address.

      <br><br>Once you've provided this information and clicked the "register" button, the website will create your
      personal
      account and save your information in their system. From then on, you can log in to your account using your email
      and password, and start using the features available on the website.

      <br><br>It's important to note that when you create an online account, you're responsible for keeping your login
      credentials safe and secure. This means choosing a strong password that's difficult to guess, and not sharing it
      with anyone else. You should also be cautious when giving out personal information online, and only provide
      information to trusted websites.

    <h1 class="dialogueHeader">Let's learn about <em>navigation bars</em>...</h1>
    <p class="dialogue">
      A navigation bar, also known as a "nav bar," is a section of a website or application that helps users navigate to
      different pages or sections within the site or app. A simple nav bar typically consists of several components that
      work together to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use navigation experience. Here is a breakdown of each of these
      components:</p>

    <ol class="dialogue">
      <li>Logo: <br>This is the icon or graphic that represents the brand or website. The logo is usually placed in the
        top
        left
        corner of the nav bar and serves as a visual anchor point for users.<br><br></li>
      <li>Menu Items: <br>These are the clickable links that lead to different sections or pages of the website. Menu
        items are typically arranged horizontally across the nav bar and can be styled in a variety of ways to make them
        stand out or blend in with the overall design of the site.<br><br></li>
      <li>Dropdown Menus: <br>Sometimes, there are too many menu items to fit in a single row of the nav bar. In this
        case, dropdown menus can be used to group related items together and create a more organized navigation
        structure.
        When a user hovers over a menu item with a dropdown, a list of additional options appears below it.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>Search Bar: <br>If the website has a large amount of content or products, a search bar can be added to the nav
        bar to allow users to quickly find what they're looking for. The search bar typically appears to the right of
        the menu items and can be accessed by clicking on a magnifying glass icon.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>Hamburger Menu:<br> On mobile devices, the nav bar may be too small to display all of the menu items. In this
        case, a hamburger menu icon can be used to reveal a hidden menu that slides out from the side of the screen when
        clicked.
        The hamburger menu icon consists of three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, resembling a
        hamburger.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="dialogue">Overall, a simple nav bar is an essential component of any website or application, as it
      provides users with a
      clear and intuitive way to navigate the site's content or functionality. By using the various components listed
      above, web designers and developers can create a nav bar that is both functional and visually appealing, helping
      to improve the user experience and drive engagement.<br><br>

      Now, let's explore the nav bar!
    </p>
    <div class="btn-container">
      <button class="tutorial-btn" onclick=secondStep() type="button">Explore</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="nav-guide-home" class="content-container">
    <h1 class="dialogueHeader">The home button</h1>
    <p class="dialogue">
      Most nav bars have a home button because it provides a clear and easy way for users to return to the main page or
      homepage of a website. The home button is usually the first or leftmost button on the nav bar, and it typically
      features the word "Home" or a small house icon.<br><br>

      Having a home button is important because it allows users to easily navigate back to the main page of a website
      from anywhere on the site. This is especially useful if the site has multiple pages or sections that users may
      explore. It also helps users who may have gotten lost or confused while browsing the site.<br><br>

      Additionally, having a home button is a common convention in web design, and users have come to expect it. It
      helps to provide a sense of familiarity and consistency across different websites, making it easier for users to
      understand and navigate new sites.<br><br>

      In summary, most nav bars have a home button because it provides an easy way for users to return to the main page
      of a website and helps to provide a sense of familiarity and consistency in web design.
